This Python program serves as a financial calculator, offering users the choice between two types of calculations: investment and home loan repayment. Let's delve into its functionality and assess the proficiency demonstrated:

User Interaction:

The program initiates by presenting the user with a menu of options (investment or bond).
It prompts the user to select an option and handles the input in a case-insensitive manner.
If the user enters an invalid option, an appropriate error message is displayed.
Investment Calculator:

If the user chooses the investment option, the program solicits additional information such as the deposit amount, interest rate, investment period, and the type of interest (simple or compound).
It computes the total amount after interest using the provided formulae for both simple and compound interest.
The calculated result is then presented to the user.
Home Loan Repayment Calculator:

If the user opts for the bond calculation, the program requests information including the present value of the house, the interest rate, and the repayment period in months.
It calculates the monthly repayment amount using the provided formula, considering the interest rate and repayment period.
The computed monthly repayment value and repayment duration are displayed to the user.
Error Handling:

The program handles erroneous inputs by notifying the user and prompting them to enter a valid option or input.
Proficiency Demonstrated:

Input Handling: Proficiency in handling user inputs effectively, including parsing numerical inputs and managing user choices.
Mathematical Computation: Competency in implementing financial formulas accurately for both investment and loan repayment calculations, including the use of mathematical functions from the math module.
Code Structure: Demonstrates clear code organization, including appropriate comments for clarity and logical structuring of the calculation processes.
Error Handling: Effective error handling to guide the user in case of invalid inputs, enhancing the overall user experience.
User Interface: Although minimalistic, the program provides a clear and intuitive user interface for interacting with the financial calculators.
Overall, this program showcases proficiency in both financial computation and user interaction, making it a valuable tool for individuals seeking to perform investment analyses or assess home loan repayment options.
